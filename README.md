# Notice!
Don't copy or stalk/harass me please! 
I'm emotionally unavailable, numb, restless, unstable and/or sensitive most of the time, so I prooobably won't react well if you only come to me in a bad mood.
I'm also selectively verbal!! And have been for a long time a lot of us just have been making ourselves talk.
I also tend to go AFK a LOT since I can get overwhelmed quickly or have a task to take care of. I am not ignoring you.
Please note that I'm also undergoing a time where I feel really strong urges to abandon my entire life and friends. It's not constantly there but is most of the time. But if I remove you, do not blame yourself.

..unless youre doing little things that upset me, then you can fuck off because you know what youre doing and i dont like it t all!!! if you hurt me then do it right, u are NOT robbie
